Several days of brainstorming and sharing my thoughts with friends gave birth to numerous ideas and it was so difficult to pick only one... I had to figure out criteria to sort them by:

1. __Originality.__ You have to be extra careful with your inspirations, or subconsciously you may start copying.
2. __Meaning.__ I'd rather take idea and bring technology to it than the other way around.
3. __Interaction.__ I felt like _Digital Revolution Exhibition_ wanted to utilize technology to bring visitors closer to the works of art.

I think _Omnisciense_ encompasses exactly that. Now to the interesting part - actually making it.

But here I face more decisions. How exactly will the film look? What tools to use to make it look that way? Where to get video clips? What hardware to use? During upcoming month and a half or so I'll document my thought process here.

For now I have a sketch to help visualize the idea:

Take a note at the progress bar at the bottom. With each post I'll update the percentage to help understand the project completeness. I consider the idea to be worth 2%.
