There are two updates from my last post. Firstly, I developed control panel and added colour filter tolerance value as a first parameter. More controls to come.

Another update - you can now input a video file to see how well screens are detected in it. Video just keeps repeating while you tune the parameters to give best results.

![Video input](project_images/video_input.png?raw=true "Video input")

I used _JavaCV_ to access individual frames. It is an _OpenCV_ and _FFmpeg_ _Java_ wrapper, but currently I only need the latter functionality. I've used _Java Media Framework_, _vlcj_ and official _OpenCV_ _Java_ wrappers before, but I chose _JavaCV_ instead, because it provides a simple access to individual frames and it supports _Maven_.

It's looking good so far and I'm optimistic about the end result. For the next update I intend to start detecting rectangular area of the screen and add more controls.
