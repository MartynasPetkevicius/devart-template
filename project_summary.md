## Description
_Omnisciense_ is a recursive journey through experiences where the act of experiencing it is part of this journey too. While travelling think of where your subjective perception ends and the objective existence begins.

From a technological viewpoint _Omniscience_ is collage of video clips, each showing a scene with some screen in it. Each scene ends with camera zooming on a screen and it in turn displays a beginning of a subsequent scene. The final scene ends with a beginning of the first one closing the loop and making for a single infinite film.

The installation at exhibition will consist of screen showing the aforementioned film and a hidden camera filming people watching this film. This footage will be dynamically added to the loop, making the act of watching film part of that same film.
